Duplicati is a backup software that schedules and stores a full or incremental copy of the files to be kept.
===*-*-*= DUPLICATI 2.0 Beta (Most Stable Version) =*-*-*===

[INFORMATION & DISCLAIMER]
This application is sensitive, as it allows indirect access to all user and system files on your server. This means that it is essential to restrict the app access, not only by setting up a strong access password but also by limiting the admin panel to the local IP address of your server or a specific domain that is secure. It is possible to enable the HTTPS protocol to encrypt communication between your device and Duplicati, but Duplicati is only in BETA and the web server is not stable in HTTPS.

Don't forget to save the configuration files of your backup plans, because in case you uninstall the application without these configuration files you will have to reconfigure the whole application as the first time (this does not apply to updates).


[ADMINISTRATION PANEL]
You can access the administration panel via : "http://your-domain-name:3200", but due to the critical systems that this application has access to we advise to block access to the WAN in the Duplicati settings and to access the application via VPN (recommended) or LAN: "http://your-server-ip:3200".


[SETUP]
(+) Securing
Go to the panel in "Panel => Settings => Access to the user interface", set a strong password and disable remote access to the panel or set a trusted domain (remember to save at the bottom of the page).

(+) Ssl/https
If you want to enable HTTPS, access your server using SFTP/SSH and follow the instructions available here: https://github.com/EndMove/duplicati-adm/blob/master/README.md#sslhttps-unstable
